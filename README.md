# Ecommerce Serverless Application

This project showcases an ecommerce application developed using serverless and microservices architectures on AWS. The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with serverless technologies, explore microservices architecture principles, deepen knowledge of AWS services, and incorporate containerization with Docker.

# Features
NodeJS Microservice: The application is built using Node.js, and it follows a microservices architecture to enable scalability, modularity, and flexibility.

Serverless Technology: Leveraging AWS Lambda and API Gateway, the application takes advantage of serverless computing to handle compute resources dynamically and reduce operational overhead.

CAP Theorem: The project explores the implications of the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) and implements appropriate strategies for each microservice.

Microservice Communication: The project demonstrates various communication patterns between microservices, such as synchronous and asynchronous communication, message queues, and event-driven architectures.

Continuous Deployment & Delivery: The application follows CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) principles, ensuring automated deployment and delivery of updates to the production environment.

Infrastructure As Code: The AWS infrastructure is defined as code using infrastructure-as-code tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK. This allows for version-controlled, reproducible, and automated infrastructure deployments.

AWS Infrastructure: The application leverages various AWS services, including but not limited to Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, and more.

Containerization with Docker: The application utilizes Docker to containerize the microservices, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.

Auto Scaling & Handling User Traffic: To accommodate varying levels of traffic, the application incorporates auto-scaling mechanisms to adjust resources dynamically based on demand.

Multiple Language Services: The microservices are implemented using different programming languages to highlight the language-agnostic nature of microservices architectures.

Logging and Monitoring: The application incorporates logging and monitoring mechanisms to gather insights into its performance, troubleshoot issues, and ensure operational excellence.
